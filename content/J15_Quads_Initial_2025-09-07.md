version: "1.0.0"
timezone: "Europe/London"
source_tests:
  - "1k @24 (last 200m free-rate)"
  - "250m sprint"
  - "2k (where available, May 2025)"
assumptions:
  - "Aidan Walker is not racing."
  - "Selections reflect tests up to 7 Sep 2025 (AM+PM)."
athletes_available:
  - "Rocky Hooper"
  - "Wilf Palmer"
  - "Zach Bain"
  - "Zan Tu Weeks"
  - "Henry Byrne"
  - "Reuben Wade"
  - "Harry Mallader"
  - "Henry Cooper"
crews:
  - name: "J15 A Quad"
    boat_class: "4x"
    steering: "Bow foot-steer"
    seats:
      - seat: "Stroke"
        athlete: "Rocky Hooper"
      - seat: "3"
        athlete: "Wilf Palmer"
      - seat: "2"
        athlete: "Zach Bain"
      - seat: "Bow"
        athlete: "Zan Tu Weeks"
    alternates: []
    rationale: |
      Rocky set a fast, efficient 1k@24 and is a reliable rhythm-setter. Wilf brings strong sustainable power. Zach adds mid-race punch from a strong 250m. Zan showed excellent rate discipline and calm, making him a steady bow/steer.
    test_notes: |
      Also test the variant with Zan stroking and Rocky bowing (see verification plan).

    seats:

        athlete: "Henry Cooper"
    alternates:
      - "Borrow-up option if required: Henry Thorpe (J14) into Bow/2 to stabilise platform (subject to event rules)."
    rationale: |
      Byrne can set an assertive but controlled rhythm. Reuben supplies force in the engine room. Harry is protected in 2-seat while technique consolidates. Cooper provides tidy bladework and reliable steering in bow.
verification_plan:
  rate_capped:
    session: "2 × 1000 m @24 spm, last 200 m free-rate"
    purpose: "Compare boat speed and efficiency without buying speed via rate creep."
    metrics:
      - "Average split at cap"
      - "Rate discipline (≤25)"
      - "Last 200 m surge smoothness"
  race_rate:
    session: "3 × 500 m @28–32 spm, 4–5 min rest"
    purpose: "Assess rhythm and timing under race-rate pressure."
    metrics:
      - "Ability to lift and hold rate"
      - "Finish timing / corrections needed"
  seat_races:
    A_quad:
      - "Swap Stroke/Bow (Rocky ↔ Zan), 1 × 750 m @26–28"
      - "Swap 3/2 (Wilf ↔ Zach), 1 × 750 m @26–28"
    B_quad:
      - "Swap Bow/2 (Cooper ↔ Harry), 1 × 750 m @24–26"
selection_criteria:
  - "Efficiency at capped rates (1k@24) — lower split at same rate = better."
  - "Top-end contribution (250m) — ability to add speed without destabilising run."
  - "Rate discipline — minimal creep beyond cap during control pieces."
  - "Technical stability — clean finishes, bladework, timing under pressure."
  - "Cohesion — boat speed with fewest corrections beats individual raw numbers."
next_actions:
  - "Re-test 1k@24 + 250m in 6–8 weeks; update lineups if data shifts."
  - "Add more J14 results and propose J14 A/B quads."
  - "Track session outcomes in the season diary webapp for change log."

# J15 Quad Lineups — Initial Selection (7 Sep 2025)

> **Note:** Aidan Walker is unavailable for racing this season. Selections are based on 1k@24, 250m, and available 2k data up to 7 Sep 2025.

## A Quad (race boat)
- **Stroke:** Rocky Hooper  
- **3:** Wilf Palmer  
- **2:** Zach Bain  
- **Bow (steer):** Zan Tu Weeks  

**Why this works:** Efficient rhythm at cap (Rocky), big sustainable power (Wilf), mid‑race punch (Zach), calm bow/steer (Zan).  
**Test variant:** Zan stroke / Rocky bow → seat‑race over 750 m @26–28.

## B Quad (development boat)
- **Stroke:** Henry Byrne  
- **3:** Reuben Wade  
- **2:** Harry Mallader  
- **Bow (steer):** Henry Cooper  

**Why this works:** Byrne sets assertive-but-controlled rhythm; Reuben supplies force;
Harry is protected in 2 while technique consolidates; Cooper’s tidy bladework + steering stabilise the shell.  
**Borrow-up option:** If numbers demand, **Henry Thorpe (J14)** can slot **Bow/2** subject to event rules.

## Verification & Review
1. **2 × 1000 m @24 spm (FR last 200 m)** — compare boat speed and rate discipline.  
2. **3 × 500 m @28–32** — assess rhythm under pressure.  
3. **Micro seat‑races** (as listed above) to confirm seat order.

**Update cadence:** Re‑check after the next test block (6–8 weeks) and adjust lineups if performance patterns change.
