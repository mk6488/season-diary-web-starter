**Date of chat:** October 2025  

#### 🎯 Goals & Priorities
- Aims to **make rowing his main sport** over rugby.  
- Plans to **continue rugby only for the rest of this academic year** because it’s part of his GCSE PE requirement, but he’s actively moving away from it due to the **injury risk** (previous arm fracture).

#### 💪 Reflections & Development
- Feels he **picked up rowing quickly** last season and has a **solid technical foundation** to build on.  
- Enjoyed gaining **race experience** (first national event was BRJC).  
- Managing the current training load but finds **Monday gym sessions** hard to fit around schoolwork; prefers using his **own home gym setup** for S&C.  
- Handles workload well overall but recognises **academic pressure is increasing**.  

#### 🧠 Motivation & What Keeps Him Coming
- Loves sport and sees rowing as a way to **disconnect from school stress**, **work on himself**, and **spend time with teammates**.  
- Values being active and outdoors rather than “stuck on a laptop doing homework.”  
- Enjoys the **social side** and the sense of **progress and self-development**.  

#### ⚙️ Practical Notes for Coaching
- Competes in **rugby on Wednesdays and Sundays** — Sunday sessions can clash with rowing, so monitor fatigue and availability.  
- Rugby involves mainly **conditioning (Broncos, fitness drills)**, minimal strength work.  
- Keep inviting him to Monday S&C but allow flexibility — he has suitable equipment and self-motivation to train independently.  
- Keep academic balance in mind; check in periodically about workload.  

#### 🧩 Summary Impression
Zan is **transitioning his athletic identity from rugby to rowing**, with a clear desire to focus on rowing performance and national-level racing. Balanced mindset, self-aware, reliable, and driven by intrinsic enjoyment rather than external pressure.
