# Erg Session – Tuesday, 9th September 2025

**Today's erg session (≈60–65 min total)**

---

## Warm-up – 12 min
- 6’ easy @ r18 (feel the ratio), then 3’ @ r20, 2’ @ r22.  
- 3 × (10 hard strokes @ r26 → 40” paddle) to wake the legs.

---

## Drill Block – 6 min (tech tidy-up)
- 2’ arms-only → arms+body  
- 2’ half-slide  
- 2’ pause @ knees  

**Cues:** hang off the handle, soft hands on recovery, quiet seat.

---

## Main Block 1 – Aerobic Base, Rate-Capped (quality steady)
- 3 × 10 min @ r20–22  
- 2’ light paddle between  

**Targets:**  
- Aim even splits (last 2’ slightly faster if form allows).  
- RPE 6–7 (comfortably hard).  
- Drag factor:  
  - J15: 110–125  
  - J14: 100–115  

---

## Main Block 2 – Rate Control Ladder (efficiency, not thrash)
- 3 × (3’ @ r22 → 2’ @ r24 → 1’ @ r26)  
- 2’ easy paddle between sets  

**Goal:** each +2 spm only drops 1.5–2.5 s/500m.  
If it drops more, you’re buying speed with strokes – lengthen instead.

---

## Cool-down – 8–10 min
- Easy @ r18  
- Breathe through the nose  
- Finish with gentle hip/ankle mobility  

---
