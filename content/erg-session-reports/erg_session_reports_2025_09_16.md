- Nailed the r22 cap, held a tight band around 2:12.

## Riley Hobeck  
**Target:** 2:48 → 2:44 @ r20–22  
- Main set not completed (multiple stops).  
- Did part of the finisher, reaching 2:00 at r32.  
**Next time:** Choose a bounded option:  
  - Either 2×8′ @ r20–21, **or**  
  - 4×2′, with two pause tokens.  
If both pause tokens are used early, switch to 3×100 strokes @ r20 with 60 strokes easy.
