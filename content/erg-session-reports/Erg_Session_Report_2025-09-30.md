## Technical Block (r18–20, pauses@knees)  
- IB25002 Andre → struggled to hold rhythm, lost focus  
- IB25012 Raghav → similar difficulties, inconsistent sequencing  
- IB25007 Harry M → struggled with concentration, losing sync at low rates

## Individual Feedback  

- **IB25015 Rocky** – Strong first 10’ piece, then notable fatigue. Still held technical form in ladders and improved as rate rose. Needs aerobic consistency when tired.  
- **IB25018 Wilf** – Inconsistent across 10’ set, but rebounded with excellent ladder execution. Shows resilience; keep working on steady pacing early.  
- **IB25001 Aidan** – Solid across both blocks, with ladders especially sharp. Main area is consistency across long steady work.  
- **IB25013 Reuben** – Slower across steady pieces, but ladders showed improved splits. Needs base conditioning and confidence at controlled rate.  
- **IB25020 Zan Tu** – Started well but drifted in second/third 10’. Ladders much stronger. Shows ability to finish well; needs to lock in rhythm earlier.  
- **IB25010 Henry T** – Entered session already fatigued from rugby; still performed well in ladders. Recovery management key. Shows toughness but must manage external load.  
- **IB25009 Henry C** – Struggled due to dizziness from earlier head knock. Must be medically cleared before resuming. Safety first.  
- **IB25002 Andre** – Technical focus, found concentration difficult at r18–20. Needs patient repetition and cues to maintain rhythm.  
- **IB25012 Raghav** – Similar to Andre; capable of strong work but focus lapses hurt sequencing. Needs close guidance.  
- **IB25007 Harry M** – Struggled to stay in sync during technical block. Needs basic rhythm control and more time at low rates.

## Observations & Coach Notes  
- **Fatigue across squad**: Several athletes depleted from external load (rugby, school). Splits reflect tiredness.  
- **Decision**: Full **week off from ergs next week** to aid recovery. Return fresh with aerobic block.  
- **Technical group**: Low-rate control remains developmental priority.

## Flags  
- **Safety**: IB25009 Henry C must be checked/cleared before next erg/water session.  
- **Training Load**: Squad recovery needed. One-week erg break in place.  
- **Technical Development**: IB25002, IB25007, IB25012 to prioritise rhythm drills and close-focus work.
