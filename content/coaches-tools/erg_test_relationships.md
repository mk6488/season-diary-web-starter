### Inter Boys Erg Test Relationships â€“ Quick Reference

This guide shows what to look for when comparing different erg tests (J14â€“J15 squad). It helps spot whether an athlete is sprint-leaning, endurance-leaning, or balanced.

---

#### **250m vs 1k@24**  (Power vs Efficiency)
- **Normal gap:** 12â€“18 sec faster on 250m. âœ… *(Green â€“ Healthy)*
- **<10 sec gap:** Endurance-leaning, may lack top-end speed. ðŸ”µ *(Blue â€“ Endurance tilt)*
- **>20 sec gap:** Sprint-leaning, weak efficiency/aerobic base. ðŸ”´ *(Red â€“ Sprint tilt)*

---

#### **1k@24 vs 2k**  (Efficiency to race distance)
- **Normal gap:** 3â€“7 sec slower on 2k. âœ… *(Green â€“ Healthy)*
- **Small gap (3â€“4 sec):** Strong aerobic profile, holds efficiency. ðŸ”µ *(Blue â€“ Endurance strength)*
- **Large gap (>7 sec):** Struggles to sustain efficiency over distance. ðŸ”´ *(Red â€“ Aerobic weakness)*

---

#### **2k vs 5k**  (Race vs aerobic base)
- **Normal gap:** 6â€“10 sec slower on 5k. âœ… *(Green â€“ Healthy)*
- **Small gap (â‰¤5 sec):** Excellent endurance, may lack sprint gear. ðŸ”µ *(Blue â€“ Endurance heavy)*
- **Large gap (â‰¥12 sec):** Weak aerobic base, fades in head-race efforts. ðŸ”´ *(Red â€“ Needs base work)*

---

#### **1k@24 vs 30r20**  (Efficiency under load)
- **Normal gap:** Within 2â€“3 sec. âœ… *(Green â€“ Healthy)*
- **Much slower 30r20:** Canâ€™t sustain efficient stroke â†’ aerobic depth issue. ðŸ”´ *(Red â€“ Aerobic weakness)*
- **Identical splits:** Excellent efficiency, strong aerobic base. ðŸ”µ *(Blue â€“ Endurance solid)*

---

#### **7-stroke max**  (Peak power)
- Strongly correlated with 250m speed.
- **High 7-stroke, average 250m:** Rate/connection problem. ðŸŸ  *(Orange â€“ Technical issue)*
- **Low 7-stroke, strong 1k@24:** Efficient endurance athlete, lacks sprint punch. ðŸ”µ *(Blue â€“ Endurance tilt)*
- **Ideal:** High peak power, fast 250m, controlled efficiency gap. âœ… *(Green â€“ Balanced)*

---

### **Healthy Profile Benchmarks**
- 250m split â‰ˆ 12â€“18s faster than 1k@24. âœ…
- 1k@24 split â‰ˆ 3â€“7s faster than 2k. âœ…
- 2k split â‰ˆ 6â€“10s faster than 5k. âœ…
- 30r20 within 2â€“3s of 1k@24. âœ…

**Too tight gaps:** Underpowered, lacks top gear. ðŸ”µ  
**Too wide gaps:** Inefficiency or aerobic weakness. ðŸ”´  

**Use:** Keep this colour-coded sheet with erg results to spot red flags quickly and decide training focus (sprint, endurance, or efficiency).
